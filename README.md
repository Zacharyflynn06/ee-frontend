The usage of this website is very straightforward.  Users can use the navigation links from the landing page to view products in the shop, and view upcoming events.  The user can also navigate to the about page to view the bands bio and some photos, use the contact page to find links to the bands agencies.

## Contributors Guide

Use the 'make a contribution' button


Navigating a new codebase can be challenging, so we're making that a little easier. As you're using docs.github.com, you may come across an article that you want to make an update to. You can click on the make a contribution button right on that article, which will take you to the file in this repo where you'll make your changes.

Before you make your changes, check to see if an issue exists already for the change you want to make.

Don't see your issue? Open one
If you spot something new, open an issue using a template. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

Note: We cannot accept contributions to the REST API reference documentation. If you spot an inaccuracy in the REST API reference documentation, open an issue in the github/rest-api-description repository.

Fork using GitHub Desktop:

Getting started with GitHub Desktop will guide you through setting up Desktop.

Fork using the command line:

Fork the repo so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
Fork with GitHub Codespaces:

Fork, edit, and preview using GitHub Codespaces without having to install and run the project locally.
Make your update:
Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update. Here are some tips and tricks for using the docs codebase.

Are you making changes to the application code? You'll need Node.js v14 to run the site locally. See contributing/development.md.
Are you contributing to markdown? We use GitHub Markdown.
Open a pull request
When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, use the pull request template to open your PR (pull request).

Submit your PR & get it reviewed
Once you submit your PR, others from the Docs community will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a self review.
After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
